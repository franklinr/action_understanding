#p the Three Little
#p Pigs
#p once upon a time there were three little pigs
#p their name were Pinky Peter and Paul
#p and they lived in a little house at the edge of the forest
#p one day their mother decided they were old enough to leave home and make their own way into the world
#p so packing their belongings each agreed that they would build their own house and grow their own food
#p now Pinky did not like work at all
#p he liked to play with all his friends much more
#p Peter also did not care too much for work but did not mind doing a little
#p Paul was only happy when he had things to do and was looking forward to his adventure
#p Pinky bought some straw from Mister Jones the farmer
#p his house in no time and built his house in no time at all
#p he put his name on the house and stood back and looked at it
#p and said oh what a clever pig I am
#p however he did not see the wolf hiding
#p there
#p suddenly the wolf sprang out and said I will huff and I will
#p and I will
#p blow your house down
#p so he huffed
#p and he puffed
#p and he blew the new house of straw all down
#p and Pinky ran away
#p oh no
#p look what he did
#q he's not very nice is he
#p no
#p meanwhile Peter was building his house with
#q what's that
#p wood
#p wood
#p thinking he would not be too long and then he could go out and play
#p he hammered the nails so fast that some of them so fast that some of them did not go through the pieces of wood
#p he laid the roof on and did not bother to nail it down
#p having put only one hinge on the door he then splashed paint all over the walls and the roof
#p he made a very poor job of it
#p the wolf watched
#p mm
#p Peter at last finished and stepped back to look at his house
#p suddenly the wicked wolf came and he huffed and he puffed and he
#p blow the house down
#p blew the house down
#p the wolf however followed the pair
#p and arriving at Paul's house he tried to get in to blow the house down
#p Paul welcomed the other two and offered them some food which he had cooked in his new fireplace
#p mm
#p later they decided to tease the wicked wolf
#p Paul crept out and climbing a tree behind his roof he threw some fruit ant the beast and ran quickly back to his safe house
#p meanwhile Paul had stoked up the fire and had placed a big pan of water on the flames
#p Pinky and Peter wondered what was Paul doing
#p soon they heard a noise and a grunt coming from the chimney
#p for a moment he did not feel the sting
#p but within seconds the wolf let out a deep deafening scream while the three little pigs danced for joy
#p the wolf sprang from the hot water ran f far away
#p the pigs never heard again heard from the pig again
#p p Pinky and Peter have learned a lesson
#p make sure when you do a job you do it well
#p and the three of them then built three brick houses
#p and as they did this together it didn't take did not take too much time to finish them
#q oh that was a good story wasn't it

#p yeah
#q where does it say Eleanor
#p let me see
#p Eleanor
#p good girl
#p there was once a velveteen rabbit
#p and in the beginning he was really splendid
#p he was plump and cuddly
#p and he had pink satin ears
#p on Christmas morning he sat up in top of Eleanor's stocking
#p there were other things in the stop stocking
#p for at least two hours Eleanor played with the rabbit
#p for a long time he lived in a toy cupboard at Twww_Dwww_Road in Cwww
#p and no one thought much about him
#p and so
#p xxx found xxx
#p xxx not just to play with but really loves you then you become real
#q your you love your teddy don't you
#p are you real said rabbit
#p Skin_horse
#p now long ago a child loved me and this made me real
#p one evening
#q what was that funny noise
#p one evening when Eleanor was going to bed she looked in her toy cupboard
#p oh here's my bunny
#p that night for many nights after the velveteen rabbit slept in Eleanor's bed
#p when Eleanor dropped off to sleep the rabbit would snuggle down close to her and cuddle her
#p with Eleanor's hands clasped close close around all night long
#p the l little rabbit was very happy
#p and all the pink rubbed off his nose where Eleanor had kissed him
#p oh no
#p a big person picked him up rubbed the dirt off him and took him back to Eleanor
#p yes
#p Eleanor herself had just had said it
#p he knew what Skin_Horse had said
#p that was a wonderful summer
#p Eleanor and Swww went to the holiday house
#p Eleanor took the velveteen rabbit on long walks
#p they must have been very well made for their seams didn't show
#p why don't you get up and play with us one of them asked
#p but the velveteen rabbit didn't wanna
#p but wild rabbits have very sharp eyes
#p look he hasn't got any hind legs
#p hind legs mean back legs like that on rabbits
#p they're called hind legs
#q okay
#p then stretch them out and show me like this said the wild rabbit beginning to whirl around and dance
#p the velveteen rabbit was longing more than anything else in the world to jump and dance
#p the wild rabbit stopped and came so close that his long whiskers whiskers brushed the velveteen rabbit's uh ears
#p the velveteen rabbit cried
#p I am real Eleanor said so
#p just then Eleanor and Swww ran past with a stamp of their feet
#p come back and play with me called the little rabbit
#p the velveteen rabbit was all alone
#p as the sun sank lower Eleanor came and carried him home
#p weeks passed and the little rabbit grew very old and shabby
#p but Eleanor loved him just as much
#p he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more except to Eleanor
#p to her he was very beautiful
#p one day Eleanor was v was ill
#p her face was flushed and she hadta stay in bed
#p he thought of lots of lovely games to play when Eleanor got better and whispered special plans in her ear
#p the day came when Eleanor was allowed to get out of bed
#p the little rabbit lay among the bedclothes listening to big people talking about holiday plans
#p for Eleanor was going away
#p he took he could hear a big person speaking
#p I think there's a good chance to sort out all the all toys
#p because it's Eleanor's birthday on Wwww
#p and the little b rabbit was put into a bag
#p oh no
#p that's sad
#p the old rabbit in the in this bag because you were got a new one for your birthday
#q it's sad you liked your old rabbit didn't you
#p later that day Eleanor brought in a splendid new bunny
#p when she fell asleep that night she was too excited to dream about anything else
#p and little velveteen rabbit lay among the rubbish and felt very lonely
#p aw look
#p and he was crying
#p and then a fairy came
#p she said I take care of all the old and worn out playthings that children have loved
#p wasn't I real before asked the little rabbit
#p you were real to Eleanor
#p run and play little rabbit
#p the seasons passed
#p and the seasons were
#q what are the seasons
#p spring
#p summer
#p autumn
#p and winter
#p while was playing with the rabbit crept while Eleanor was playing the rabbit crept out from the long grass and looked at her
#p one of the rabbits had strange markings
#p Eleanor stood very still and looked at the little rabbit
#p why she said he looks just like my lovely old bunny that was lost just after I was ill
#p but Eleanor never knew that it really was velveteen rabbit
#p come back to look at the old that child who had first helped him to be real
